## 2. Email Pitch

**Subject:** Quick collab idea for you — no upfront cost, pure rev-share

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Found you through TikTok and loved your [specific video or series]. Your audience clearly trusts your recommendations — that's exactly what brands pay for.

I run a small affiliate management program for beauty and skincare creators. Here's how it works:

- You get a tracked affiliate link for products that fit your niche
- Every sale you drive earns you a commission (paid out by the brand)
- I handle brand relationships, link setup, and performance reporting
- Zero cost to you. Zero obligation to post a minimum number of videos.

I take a small management fee from your earnings (you'd know the exact % upfront). You keep the majority.

You'd be a great fit based on your skincare content and engaged audience.

Interested? I can send over a one-page breakdown in under 5 minutes.

## 3. Follow-Up DM (No Reply After 3 Days)

```
Hey [name] — just following up on my DM from a few days ago. No pressure at all. If timing's off or you're not taking collabs right now, totally fine — just let me know and I won't bother you again. If you're curious, happy to share more details!
```

**Note:** Send once. If no reply after this follow-up, mark as churned and move on.

## 4. Onboarding Message (Creator Said Yes)

**Send via DM or email depending on how you connected.**

---

Hey [name], awesome — let's get you set up. Here's exactly what happens next:

**Step 1 — Product match**
I'll send you 2–3 products that fit your content style. You pick the one you actually want to talk about. If none fit, we find something that does.

**Step 2 — Your affiliate link**
I'll send you a tracked TikTok Shop (or network) link. It's specific to you — every sale through your link is credited to you.

**Step 3 — Your first post**
Post when it feels natural. No scripts required. Honest reaction content performs best. Always include #affiliate or #ad per FTC rules.

**Step 4 — Payouts**
Commissions are paid by the affiliate network directly to you on their schedule (usually net-30). I'll confirm the exact payout terms per product.

**Your cut:** [X]% of every commission you earn goes to me as a management fee. You keep the rest. This is disclosed upfront and won't change without your agreement.

**There is no contract to sign right now.** You can stop at any time.

Any questions before we pick your first product?

## 5. Rev-Share Agreement Summary (Plain English)

**Creator Affiliate Management Agreement — Summary**

This is not a legal document. It's a plain-English summary of our working arrangement. A formal agreement can be provided on request.

---

**Who we are**
You are a TikTok content creator. I (Connor) manage affiliate partnerships on your behalf — handling brand relationships, link setup, tracking, and reporting.

**How you make money**
You promote products using a unique affiliate link. When someone buys through your link, the affiliate network pays a commission. That money is yours.

**My management fee**
I take [20–30]% of the affiliate commissions you earn as a management fee. The exact percentage is agreed before you post anything and is fixed for each product campaign. You keep the remaining [70–80]%.

**Example**
You earn $500 in commissions in a month. At 25%, I receive $125. You receive $375. The brand pays the full $500 — no cost comes out of your pocket.

**What I do for you**
- Source products that match your audience
- Set up and manage your tracked links
- Monitor your performance and flag what's working
- Handle any brand-side issues
- Report your earnings to you monthly

**What you do**
- Post honest content about products you're promoting
- Include #affiliate or #ad in every sponsored post (legally required)
- Use only the tracked link I provide (not a raw product URL)

**Costs to you**
Zero. There is no upfront cost, no retainer, no minimum posting requirement.

**Payouts**
The affiliate network pays you directly. Payout schedules vary by network (typically net-30 to net-60). I never hold your money.

**Ending the arrangement**
Either party can end this at any time with no notice required. Commissions already earned before the end date are still paid out per network schedule.

**Exclusivity**
This is non-exclusive. You are free to work with other managers or affiliate programs unless we explicitly agree otherwise for a specific campaign.

## 6. Objection Responses

---

### Objection 1: "How much will I actually make?"

**Response:**

It depends on your audience size, engagement, and which product you promote, so I won't give you a fake number. What I can tell you: micro-creators in the 10K–100K range typically earn $2–$15 per sale depending on the product. If you drive 20–50 sales a month — which is realistic with one or two honest posts — that's $40–$750 in commissions. Your cut is 70–80% of that. I'll show you your real performance data every month so you know exactly where things stand.

---

### Objection 2: "Do I have to post a certain number of times?"

**Response:**

No minimum. Post when it fits your content naturally. Forced posts perform badly anyway — for both of us. Most creators start with one video, see how it lands, and decide from there. You're never obligated to post again if you don't want to.

---

### Objection 3: "I've been burned by brand deals before."

**Response:**

Completely fair. The difference here is there's no upfront obligation and I don't pay you a flat rate — which means I only earn if you earn. My incentive is to set you up with products that actually convert for your audience, not to push random products and disappear. If something isn't working after a few posts, I'll tell you and we'll pivot or part ways cleanly.

---

### Objection 4: "Why do you take a cut? Can't I just do this myself?"

**Response:**

You absolutely can — and if you'd rather manage your own affiliate links directly, I'll point you in the right direction. What I offer is speed and product access: I've already vetted products, have affiliate relationships set up, and handle the tracking and reporting. My fee covers that infrastructure. If you're already running your own affiliate links successfully, this probably isn't for you. If you're not yet, working with me gets you started in days, not months.

---

### Objection 5: "I don't want to seem salesy to my audience."

**Response:**

That's actually the right instinct — and it's why honest review-style content works better than scripted ads. You're not being asked to hard-sell anything. The content that converts best on TikTok is "I tried this, here's what I actually think" — your normal voice, your real opinion. You pick products you'd actually use. You don't post it if you don't like it. There's no script. Your audience trusts you because you're real — we want to keep it that way.
