## 3. 10 PROVEN VIRAL VIDEO FRAMEWORKS

### Framework 1: "I tried X for 30 days"
**Structure (60-90 seconds):**
```
[0-3s]  HOOK: "I used [product] every single day for 30 days and here's what actually happened"
[3-10s] Problem setup: "I've struggled with [problem] for years"
[10-25s] Show the product, explain why you chose it
[25-50s] Week-by-week results with visual proof
[50-65s] Final reveal — be honest (builds trust = more conversions)
[65-75s] "Link in bio if you want to try it"
```
**Why it works:** Completion rate is high (people wait for the result). Perceived authenticity = trust = clicks.

**Hook variations:**
- "30 days, 1 product, ACTUAL results"
- "I gave this 30 days. Here's what nobody tells you."
- "Consistent use of X for 30 days — worth it?"

---

### Framework 2: "POV: You discovered X"
**Structure (15-30 seconds):**
```
[0-2s]  Text on screen: "POV: You just discovered the [product] that [benefit]"
[2-8s]  Show product in use, satisfying visual
[8-20s] Key feature demonstration
[20-25s] "It's in my bio"
```
**Why it works:** POV format creates immersive identification. Short = high completion rate = algorithm boost.

**Hook variations:**
- "POV: You found the skincare product that actually cleared your skin"
- "POV: You discovered why everyone is obsessed with this"
- "POV: Your Amazon cart just got dangerous"

---

### Framework 3: "Things I wish I knew before buying X"
**Structure (45-75 seconds):**
```
[0-3s]  HOOK: "Before you buy [product], watch this"
[3-15s] Mistake #1 (what to avoid / what to look for)
[15-30s] Mistake #2 + the better alternative you found
[30-50s] What to actually look for / the best option
[50-65s] Results + soft CTA: "I linked the one I use"
```
**Why it works:** Educational content gets saved (saves = massive algorithm signal). Saved videos get recommended to cold audiences.

---

### Framework 4: Unboxing + Honest Review
**Structure (60-90 seconds):**
```
[0-3s]  HOOK: "Okay I spent $[price] on this and..." (curiosity gap)
[3-15s] Unboxing — show packaging, first impressions
[15-35s] Testing it live on camera
[35-55s] Real reaction — pros AND cons (cons = credibility)
[55-70s] Final verdict + "Link in bio"
```
**Why it works:** Comments section floods with "link?" = free engagement boost. Cons make it credible = higher CTR than pure positive reviews.

**Critical:** Never fake your reaction. Viewers detect inauthenticity instantly.

---

### Framework 5: "Amazon Finds That Actually Work"
**Structure (45-90 seconds, list format):**
```
[0-3s]  HOOK: "Amazon finds under $30 that I actually use every day"
[3-20s] Product 1: Show, demo, one key benefit
[20-35s] Product 2: Show, demo, one key benefit
[35-50s] Product 3: (Best for last — your highest commission item)
[50-65s] "All linked in my bio, organized by price"
```
**Why it works:** List format = high watch time. Viewer stays for all 3. Multiple products = multiple commission opportunities from one video.

**Optimization:** Put your highest-EPC product last (people remember the last thing most).

---

### Framework 6: Before/After Demonstrations
**Structure (30-60 seconds):**
```
[0-2s]  HOOK: Show the "before" — the problem state
[2-5s]  "Watch what happens when I use [product]"
[5-30s] Transformation process (satisfying to watch)
[30-45s] After reveal — dramatic pause for effect
[45-55s] Product name + where to get it
```
**Why it works:** Before/after is the most-shared content format across all social media. High emotional payoff = shares = free reach.

**Best for:** Skincare, cleaning products, organization, fitness, hair care.

---

### Framework 7: Duet/Stitch with Trending Content
**Structure (30-45 seconds):**
```
[0-3s]  React to original video's claim/question
[3-20s] Your response using your product as the answer
[20-35s] Demonstration
[35-45s] "Link in my bio" — soft close
```
**Why it works:** Piggybacks on existing viral momentum. TikTok algorithm actively promotes duets of popular videos.

**Strategy:** Find trending videos with 500K-5M views in your niche (not 50M+ — too competitive). Duet within 24-48 hours of their peak.

---

### Framework 8: Day-in-My-Life Product Integration
**Structure (60-180 seconds, lifestyle format):**
```
[0-5s]  HOOK: "Come spend the day with me" or "My morning routine"
[5-30s] Morning segment — feature product #1 naturally
[30-60s] Midday — feature product #2 in context
[60-90s] Evening — feature product #3 (your highest ticket item)
[90-120s] "Everything I used today is linked in my bio"
```
**Why it works:** Lifestyle integration feels authentic, not salesy. Aspirational content drives purchase intent. Multiple products = multiple revenue opportunities.

---

### Framework 9: "Stop Scrolling If You Need X"
**Structure (15-30 seconds, urgent format):**
```
[0-2s]  TEXT HOOK: "Stop scrolling if you've been looking for [specific problem solution]"
[2-8s]  "I found it and I need you to see this"
[8-20s] Quick demo or result reveal
[20-28s] "I can't stop using it. Link in bio."
```
**Why it works:** Direct address creates pattern interrupt. Viewer self-selects = higher CTR from highly qualified traffic. Short = can be posted multiple times per day.

---

### Framework 10: Comparison Videos
**Structure (60-90 seconds):**
```
[0-3s]  HOOK: "I tested [Product A] vs [Product B] so you don't have to"
[3-20s] Test criteria (set expectations)
[20-40s] Side-by-side test — Product A performance
[40-60s] Product B performance (make it close for drama)
[60-75s] Winner reveal + why (link the winner)
[75-85s] "Loser" gets a consolation: "Great if you're on a budget"
```
**Why it works:** High completion rate (viewers want the verdict). Comments war = engagement boost. Covers both products = captures wider audience.

## 6. CAPTION TEMPLATES WITH SEO HASHTAG STRATEGY

### Caption Formula

[Soft CTA]
[Disclosure: #affiliate #ad]
[Strategic hashtags]
```

```

### Template 2: Amazon Finds
```

#amazonfinds #amazonmusthaves #affiliate #[niche] #tiktokmademebuyit #founditonamazon
```

### Template 3: Before/After
```

[Specific result description]. [Timeframe] of consistent use.

Link in bio — same product I've been using since day 1.

#affiliate #[niche] #beforeandafter #[product type] #resultsthatspeak #[brand if allowed]
```

### Hashtag Strategy by Category

**Master hashtag list — rotate these, don't use all at once:**

High-volume (1B+ views) — use 1-2 max:
`#tiktokmademebuyit` `#amazonfinds` `#fyp` `#foryou`

Medium-volume (100M-1B) — use 2-3:
`#amazonfavorites` `#affordablefinds` `#musthaves` `#productreview` `#honest review`

Niche-specific (10M-100M) — use 3-4:
- Beauty: `#skincaretiktok` `#glowup` `#skincarevienna` `#beautytips`
- Fitness: `#gymtok` `#fitnesstips` `#supplementreview` `#workout`
- Home: `#homeorganization` `#homegadgets` `#cleantok` `#homefinds`
- AI Tools: `#aitools` `#productivity` `#techreview` `#worksmart`
- Pet: `#pettok` `#dogsoftiktok` `#catsooftiktok` `#petproducts`

Low-competition (1M-10M) — use 2-3 (best for ranking):
- Your specific niche + "finds", "reviews", "must-haves"
- "[Product type] + review"
- "[Problem] + solution"

**Total hashtags per post: 8-12**
**Never use the same hashtag set twice in a row — rotate between 3 different sets**
