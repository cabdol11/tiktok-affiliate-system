## 0 → $10,000/Week Net: 12-Week Growth System

---

## PHASE 1: WEEKS 1–4 — ORGANIC GROWTH (ZERO AD SPEND)

### Goal: 50–100 sales/week by end of Week 4

### Week 1: Foundation & Data Collection
**Primary objective:** Post consistently, learn the algorithm, find your first viral format.

**Daily actions:**
- Post 3-5 videos per day across 3 time windows
- Reply to EVERY comment within 30 minutes of posting (boosts distribution 40-60%)
- Track which hooks get the most 3-second views (check TikTok Analytics → "Audience Reached" per video)
- Monitor which videos get profile visits (your most important mid-funnel metric)

**Content mix:**
- 60% product demos/reviews (conversion content)
- 30% educational/value (trust building)
- 10% trending audio + product (reach plays)

**What to measure:**
- Average watch time % (target: above 50%)
- Profile visit rate (target: above 2% of viewers)
- Link-in-bio click rate (target: above 0.5% of viewers)

**Week 1 expected results:** 500–5,000 total views, 0–3 sales. This is normal. You're training the algorithm.

---

### Week 2: Double Down on Winners
**Primary objective:** Identify the 1-2 video formats that outperform and scale them.

**Algorithm pattern recognition:**
- Any video with above-average completion rate (>60%) → make 3 variations of it this week
- Any video that drove profile visits → replicate the hook, use different product
- Videos that got "link?" comments → you found a converting format, double output

**Organic SEO on TikTok:**
- Research: Go to TikTok search, type your niche keyword, look at "Others searched for" suggestions
- Include those exact phrases in your first spoken sentence (TikTok transcribes audio for search)
- Add location if relevant (e.g., "best skincare in 2025" gets search traffic)

**Week 2 goals:**
- 1 video crossing 10,000 views
- First sale (link click → conversion)
- Email list: get first 10 subscribers via Beacons.ai bio link

---

### Week 3: Product Rotation & Offer Testing
**Primary objective:** Find your highest-EPC product. Not the highest commission — the one that actually converts.

**Product testing protocol:**
- Promote 3 different products this week (one per "slot" in your content mix)
- Track clicks-per-video AND conversions per product separately in affiliate_tracker.py
- After 50+ clicks on each product, compare EPC (earnings per click)
- Kill the bottom performer, double posts for the top 2

**Niche authority building:**
- Start a "series" format: "Day 3 of testing X" gets people to follow for the update
- Pin your best-performing video to your profile
- Add "For more finds → link in bio" to your profile bio

**Week 3 goals:**
- 2,000+ profile views
- 5–10 sales/week
- Identify your #1 highest-EPC product

---

### Week 4: Systematize & Batch Create
**Primary objective:** Stop creating reactively, start batch producing.

**Batch production system:**
- Choose Sunday as your film day: batch record 10-15 raw videos
- Monday: edit and schedule all videos for the week using TikTok's built-in scheduler
- Tuesday-Saturday: spend 30 min/day engaging with comments + monitoring analytics
- This frees up brain space to focus on product research and optimization

**Creator collaboration (free traffic):**
- Find 5 creators in adjacent niches (not direct competitors) with 5K-50K followers
- Offer to duet their content (free exposure to their audience)
- Comment genuinely on their content before reaching out (warm them up)

**Week 4 goals:**
- 20–30 sales/week
- 1,000+ TikTok followers
- Batch workflow producing 30+ videos/week with 2-3 hours of daily work

---

## PHASE 2: WEEKS 5–8 — TIKTOK SPARK ADS (AMPLIFY WINNERS)

### Goal: 150–200 sales/week by end of Week 8

### What are Spark Ads?
Spark Ads boost your EXISTING organic posts as paid ads. Unlike dark ads (created in Ads Manager), Spark Ads:
- Keep all organic engagement (likes, comments, shares stay visible)
- Use your existing social proof (10K likes on an organic post = high-trust ad)
- Cost less per click than standard TikTok ads (30-50% lower CPM typically)
- Can be whitelisted from Creator accounts (run ads as your creator handle)

### Week 5: First Spark Ad Campaign

**Which video to boost:**
- Filter your organic posts: views > 15,000 AND link-click rate > 1%
- This means the content already converts, you're just buying more traffic
- Do NOT boost videos with high views but low profile visits (they entertained, they didn't sell)

**Campaign setup:**
```
Objective:      Traffic (to bio link) or Website Conversions (if you have pixel)
Budget:         $20/day to start (test for 3 days = $60 total test budget)
Audience:       Broad first — let TikTok's algorithm find buyers
                Interest: [Your niche]
                Behavior: "Engaged with similar content in last 7 days"
Age:            18-45 (adjust after seeing which ages convert)
Placement:      TikTok only (no Pangle/third-party placements)
Bid strategy:   Lowest cost (auto-bid to start)
```

**Week 5 ad budget:** $20/day × 7 = $140
**Expected results:** 200-500 additional clicks, 3-10 additional sales
**Target ROAS:** 2.0x minimum (spend $140, earn $280+)

---

### Week 6: Optimize and Scale Winning Ads

**After 3 days of data, evaluate each ad:**
- ROAS > 3x → increase budget by 30% every 48 hours (never more than 30% at a time)
- ROAS 2-3x → keep running, test new creative
- ROAS < 2x → kill the ad, boost a different organic video

**A/B testing with Spark Ads:**
- Boost 2 different videos for the same product simultaneously
- Run both at $20/day for 72 hours
- The winner gets 80% of remaining budget, loser gets cut

**Audience expansion:**
- If broad audience works at ROAS 3x+ → create a Lookalike Audience from your bio link visitors
- Requires TikTok Pixel on your landing page (or Beacons.ai conversion tracking)
- Lookalike audiences typically outperform interest targeting by 20-40%

**Week 6 target ad spend:** $200-300/week
**Expected results:** 80-120 sales from paid, 30-50 from organic = 110-170 total

---

### Week 7: TikTok Shop + Spark Ads Combination
**The most powerful TikTok affiliate monetization stack:**

1. Post organic TikTok video with TikTok Shop product tagged
2. Video gets organic views → in-app purchases (no link-in-bio friction)
3. Boost top-performing TikTok Shop videos with Spark Ads
4. In-app checkout = 3-5x higher CVR than external links

**TikTok Shop Spark Ad setup:**
- Objective: "Product Sales" (not Traffic)
- This optimizes for purchases, not just clicks
- Set product in ad → TikTok handles checkout
- Commission paid automatically every week

**Week 7 targets:**
- 50%+ of revenue through TikTok Shop (higher CVR)
- 30-50 sales from TikTok Shop + 50-80 from external links = 80-130 total

---

### Week 8: Creator Network Pilot
**Recruiting your first 2-3 sub-creators:**

**What to offer:**
- 50% of the commissions generated by their videos
- You provide: product list, video scripts/frameworks, affiliate link setup
- They provide: their TikTok account, face, filming

**Where to find creators:**
1. Your own comments section: Look for people asking about products — they're already engaged
2. TikTok Creator Marketplace: Filter by niche, follower count 5K-50K, high engagement rate
3. Instagram DMs to micro-creators in your niche (often untapped)

**Revenue share structure:**
- 10K-50K follower creator: offer 50% commission split
- 50K-200K creator: offer 40% (their audience is worth more)
- 200K+ creator: negotiate brand deal rate + 20% commission

**Written agreement must include:**
- FTC disclosure requirements (their responsibility)
- Exclusivity clause (can't promote competing products simultaneously)
- Payment terms (weekly, via PayPal or Stripe)
- Content approval process (you review before posting)

**Week 8 targets:** 150-200 total sales/week, first sub-creator posting their first video

## PHASE 3: WEEKS 9–12 — FULL PAID TRAFFIC SYSTEM

### Goal: 300+ sales/week by end of Week 12

### Week 9: TikTok Ads Manager Full Campaign Build

**Campaign structure (VSS: Video Shopping Ads):**
```
Campaign Level:
  Objective: Product Sales or Conversions
  Campaign Budget: $200/day

Ad Group Level:
  Ad Group 1: Broad — Interest: [niche], All ages, No behavior targeting

Ad Level:
  Creative A: Your best organic video (Spark Ad)
  Creative B: New UGC-style video (shot specifically for ads)
  Creative C: Text-overlay listicle format (works well for product discovery)
```

**Retargeting setup:**
- Install TikTok Pixel on Beacons.ai via custom code (Beacons supports this)
- Create Custom Audience: "Visited bio link page" last 30 days
- Retargeting ad message: "Still thinking about it? Here's why it's worth it"
- Retargeting typically has 3-5x higher ROAS than cold traffic

---

### Week 10: Email/SMS List Monetization

**List building funnel:**
```
TikTok Video → Bio Link (Beacons.ai)
             → ConvertKit landing page: "Get my weekly product finds"
             → Email subscriber
             → Welcome sequence (3 emails)
             → Weekly "Top 5 Finds" newsletter with affiliate links
```

**ConvertKit welcome sequence (3 emails):**

- Email 3 (Day 7): "My weekly picks + a discount code"
  - Use any coupon codes from your affiliate programs

- Build SMS list via: "Text DEALS to [number] for weekly product alerts"

**Monetization potential at 1,000 email subscribers:**

- At 10,000 subscribers → $1,120/week passive income

---

### Week 11: Multi-Platform Expansion

**Instagram Reels repurposing:**
- Download your TikTok videos WITHOUT watermark (use SnapTik.app)
- Re-upload to Instagram Reels
- Use Instagram's "Add link" sticker in Stories (drives direct traffic)
- Instagram affiliate: Instagram has its own native affiliate program (Creator content)
- Expected: 20-30% additional reach from same content, zero extra work

**YouTube Shorts repurposing:**
- Same TikToks → YouTube Shorts
- YouTube Shorts monetization: Once you hit 1,000 subs + 10M Shorts views, you earn ad revenue

- YouTube traffic converts at 2-3x TikTok rate (higher intent searchers)

**Pinterest repurposing:**
- Create static image versions of your best products (use Canva)
