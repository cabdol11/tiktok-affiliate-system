## WHO TO TARGET

**Ideal prospect profile:**
- DTC brand with TikTok Shop already set up
- Monthly GMV: $10K–$500K (needs scale, doesn't have it yet)
- Niche: beauty, skincare, supplements, home, fashion
- Fewer than 50 active affiliates in their shop
- Spending on TikTok paid ads (Spark Ads) = already believes in the platform

**How to find them:**
1. TikTok Shop product search → filter by category → find brands with <50 reviews on their shop page
2. LinkedIn → search "TikTok Shop" + "founder" or "DTC" → filter: 1–50 employees
3. Shopify app store reviews for TikTok integration apps → brands mentioning TikTok growing pains
4. TikTok itself → watch any beauty/supplement viral video → check if brand has Shop enabled → DM the brand account

## SEQUENCE 1 — COLD EMAIL (Primary Channel)

### Email 1 — Day 1 (Initial Outreach)

**Subject:** Your TikTok Shop affiliate program

```
Hi [First Name],

Came across [Brand] on TikTok Shop — you have a strong product and
the category is clearly moving.

I run a managed affiliate network. We recruit and activate creators
specifically for TikTok Shop, and we work on pure performance —
percentage of GMV we generate, zero upfront.

We're currently generating $[X]K–$[X]M/month for brands in [their niche].

Worth a 15-minute call to see if there's a fit?

[Your name]
```

### Email 2 — Day 4 (Follow-up 1)

**Subject:** Re: Your TikTok Shop affiliate program

```
Hi [First Name],

Following up on my last note.

Quick context: one brand we work with in [their niche] went from
~$30K/month GMV to $180K/month in 60 days. The change was purely
distribution — same product, more creators who actually convert.

If affiliate isn't a priority right now, no problem. But if you're
trying to grow GMV without doubling ad spend, I think we can help.

15 minutes this week?

[Your name]
```

---

### Email 3 — Day 10 (Follow-up 2 — Pattern Interrupt)

**Subject:** Quick question about [Brand]

```
Hi [First Name],

Last note, I promise.

One question: are you currently running a TikTok Shop affiliate program,
or relying primarily on paid ads?

If it's mostly paid — that's the gap we fix. Happy to show you exactly
how on a quick call.

[Your name]
```

---

### Email 4 — Day 21 (Break-up / Reopen)

**Subject:** Closing your file

```
Hi [First Name],

I'm going to stop following up — clearly the timing isn't right.

If TikTok Shop affiliate growth becomes a priority down the road,
I'm easy to find.

One thing I'll leave you with: the brands in your category doing
$500K+/month on TikTok Shop are doing it almost entirely through
affiliates, not ads. When you're ready to build that, reach out.

[Your name]
```

## SEQUENCE 2 — LINKEDIN DM

### Message 1 — Connection Request Note (300 chars max)

```
Hi [Name] — saw [Brand] on TikTok Shop. Strong product in a fast-moving
category. I run a TikTok Shop affiliate network. Would love to connect.
```

---

### Message 2 — After Connection Accepted

```
Thanks for connecting [Name].

We manage TikTok Shop affiliate programs for DTC brands — pure
performance, no upfront fee. We handle creator recruitment, product
seeding, commission management, and reporting.

Currently working with [X] brands in [their niche].

Would you be open to a quick call to explore if we're a fit for [Brand]?
```

---

### Message 3 — If No Reply (Day 7)

```
Hi [Name] — wanted to make sure this didn't get buried.

Short version: we grow TikTok Shop GMV through affiliates, performance-only.
One brand we work with in your space went from $40K to $220K/month GMV
in 90 days.

Happy to send a 2-minute overview if useful — no call needed to start.
```

---

## SEQUENCE 3 — TIKTOK DM (Brand Account)

### Message 1

```
Hi [Brand] — love the product. I run a TikTok Shop affiliate network
and think you'd scale fast with the right creator distribution.

We work performance-only — no upfront cost. Do you have a founder or
marketing contact I could connect with?
```

---

## SEQUENCE 4 — DEMO CALL SCRIPT

### Opening (first 60 seconds)

> "Thanks for the time. I'll be direct — I'm not going to pitch you today.
> I want to understand where [Brand] is with TikTok Shop and see if what
> we do is actually relevant. Can you tell me: what's your current monthly
> GMV, and how much of that is coming from affiliates vs paid ads?"

**Listen. Do not talk.**

---

### After They Answer

**If GMV is low and mostly paid ads:**
> "That's exactly the gap we fix. What's happening is your product is
> converting well when creators put it in front of the right audience —
> you just don't have the infrastructure to recruit and manage those
> creators at scale. That's what we've built."

**If they have some affiliates but want more:**
> "Good — you've proven the model works. The question is whether you
> want to run it in-house and build the system yourself, or plug into
> ours and start scaling in the next 30 days."

---

### The Offer (present two options only — never one)

> "Based on what you've told me, I'd suggest one of two paths:
>
> **Option 1 — Managed:** We run your entire affiliate program.
> Creator recruitment, seeding, daily management, reporting.
> You pay us [15–20]% of the GMV we generate. Zero if we don't perform.
>
> **Option 2 — Self-serve:** We give your team access to our platform —
> creator network, tracking, commission automation, analytics.
> $[499–999]/month. You run it, we support it.
>
> Most brands start with managed because it's zero risk.
> Which feels more aligned with where you are?"

---

### Objections

**"We're not ready yet"**
> "Totally understand. What would need to be true for you to be ready?
> I want to make sure I'm talking to you at the right time, not the wrong one."

**"We already work with an agency"**
> "Good — means you understand the value. How's the performance?
> Are you hitting your GMV targets? If so, stay with them.
> If not, we should talk."

**"What's your take rate?"**
> "15–20% of what we generate for you. If we don't perform, you pay nothing.
> The only risk you're taking is 30 days of time."

**"I need to think about it"**
> "Of course. What's the one thing you want to think through?
> I'd rather address it now than have you hold a question for two weeks."

---

### Close

> "Here's what I'd suggest: let's run a 30-day pilot.
> We activate 20 creators on one hero product, you see the results,
> then we decide if it makes sense to scale.
> If it works, great. If not, you've lost nothing.
>
> Can we shake on a 30-day pilot?"
