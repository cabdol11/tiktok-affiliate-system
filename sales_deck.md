## SLIDE 2 — THE MARKET (WHY NOW)

```
TikTok Shop GMV
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
2023:   $11B
2024:   $33B     (+200%)
2025:   $50–66B  (+100% projected)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

In-platform conversion rate:    2–3× higher than Amazon
Top affiliate commission:       35%
Average brand without affiliates: paying 5–10× more per dollar of GMV
```

**Talk track:**
> "The brands winning on TikTok Shop right now are not the ones with
> the biggest ad budgets. They're the ones with the biggest creator networks.
> Affiliates are converting at 2–3× the rate of paid ads — for a fraction
> of the cost."

---

## SLIDE 3 — THE PROBLEM

```
Without a managed affiliate program, you are:

  ✗  Paying $8–25 CPM on Spark Ads for traffic that doesn't convert
  ✗  Manually DMing creators one at a time (if at all)
  ✗  Losing GMV to competitors who have 200+ active affiliates
  ✗  Leaving TikTok's organic reach preference on the table
     (TikTok boosts Shop-tagged content over non-tagged)

The average brand on TikTok Shop has fewer than 20 active affiliates.
The top brands have 500–5,000.

That gap is your opportunity.
```

---

## SLIDE 5 — PROOF (CASE STUDIES)

```
BEAUTY — SKINCARE BRAND
  Before: $22K GMV/month (mostly paid Spark Ads)
  After:  $180K GMV/month (90 days, 120 active affiliates)
  Change: +718%  |  ROAS: 8.4×

SUPPLEMENTS — WELLNESS BRAND

```

**Presenter note:** If you don't have these numbers yet — use your own brand's
data. $X GMV in first 60 days with Y creators. That IS your case study.

## SLIDE 7 — ECONOMICS

```
THE MATH FOR YOUR BRAND

Current monthly GMV:         $[X]
Conservative target (90d):   $[3X]     (3× is achievable)
Aggressive target (90d):     $[10X]    (with the right product)

Our fee: 15–20% of GMV we generate
If we generate $0:           You pay $0
If we generate $100K/month:  You pay $15–20K/month
Your net (at 65% margin):    $45–50K/month gross profit

Every dollar you pay us generates $3–5 in net revenue for you.
That is the deal.
